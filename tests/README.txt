Here is the summary of all the examples included:

"test_0"  -  A basic test for an AGN point source, with given intrinsic and microlensing variability light curves.
"test_1"  -  Same as 'test_0', but it includes an additional unmicrolensed intrinsic signal from the source (e.g. coming from a large area like the BELR).
"test_2"  -  Same as 'test_0', but now the microlensing light curves will be generated from magnification maps on the fly, using the 'moving_disc' model. If the maps are missing, a download link is provided automatically.
"test_3"  -  A selected microlensing light curve trajectory from 'test_0' (index: 20), for which cutouts are also calculated.
"test_4"  -  Same as 'test_0' but now the point source is replaced by an expanding supernova and the cadence of the observations is changed.
"test_5"  -  Same as 'test_0' but now the point source is removed and there are gridded lens potential perturbations present.
